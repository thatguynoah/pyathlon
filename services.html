										<h5>Project One - Cancer Diagnosis</h5>
										<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/r_code.jpg" alt="" /></span>This project was done for the US military sponsored Michigan Southeastern JHSH science fair in 2021. For this project a broad array of softwares were used to design a Naive Bayes artificial intelligence to diagnose lung cancer. First, bioinformatic data was downloaded through the R programming language by interfacing with the NIH’s GEO platform. The data was an amalgamation of control (benign) and experimental (malignant) patients who had lung nodule cancer. That data was then imported into Python where Pandas, Numpy, and Scikit-learn were implemented to design the code. Pandas and Numpy were used to combine multiple data frames and reformat the data to be inputted into Scikit-learn functions. Then a Naive Bayes AI was implemented and optimized with the aforementioned module, Scikit-Learn. Overall, this machine learning program achieved an efficacy of over 80%, which makes it a very good diagnostic tool.</p>
										<h5>Project Two - Excel Combiner</h5>
                                        <p><span class="image right"><img src="images/what_we_are.jpg" alt="" /></span>This project was developed for the michigan non-profit miRcore, which specializes in teaching high school students bioinformatics and computational biology. This CLI based program functions as an Exe so to be downloaded on anyone’s computer. The program intakes two local file paths. One file consists solely of gene ids and symbols, the other contains ids and any other number of other columns. The file will iterate through both files and output a Csv file containing all of the information of the original file (not containing gene symbols) and the ids corresponding gene symbols. This program will be used to gain a greater understanding of volcano plots generated when analyzing genomic datasets. This program was very challenging because iterating through each line of code was too computationally intensive as there are thousands of entries in each file. Instead we had to use code optimization to speed up the process. Ultimately, the run time was reduced from over 6 hours to under 2 minutes!</p>
