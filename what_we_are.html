										<h3 class="major">Philosophy</h3>
										<p>At Pyathlon, we believe everyone should have the opportunity to engage in awesome and interesting coding projects. All of our articles, beginner or other level, will clearly explain what is being done and why. Coding, while being deconstructed, is still elitist. It is perpetuated that people need a certain caliber of intelligence, education, or inherent ability to start coding. This is unfathomably wrong and we seek to disprove that with our content.</p>
										<p>Founder Noah Black believes that anyone can learn difficult concepts, both in code and not, through concise and engaging content. This site seeks exactly that, engaging content meant to teach a litany of skills through the medium of code. We want to educate and empower people who have experience in code and absolute beginners.</p>
										<p>Noah had this to say:</p>
										<blockquote>“Being a person who isn’t naturally gifted or inherently smart in any way, I understand the difficulty of learning to code and all manner of other complex subjects. However easy it is to stay lazy and abuse that quality, I learned that anyone can learn difficult things through great teachers. I hope to share those teachings, lessons, and explorations on this site.”</blockquote>

										<h3 class="major">Goals and Plans</h3>
										<p>As of now, Pyathlon is in its early stages of development. As such, it has many goals which it will attempt to accomplish in the long run. On the top most level we hope to introduce people to the Python programming language and develop their skill set. Additionally, we hope to improve on skills that intermediate or advanced programmers have already acquired. Through a variety of tutorials, projects, and multidisciplinary endeavors we hope to explore the profound benefits computer science can have you and the world. We hope that our project based approach to learning will prove a fun and engaging way to learn.</p>
										<p>Here's a list of Python modules we hope to cover soon:</p>
										<ul>
											<li>Random</li>
											<li>Numpy</li>
											<li>Pandas</li>
											<li>Math</li>
											<li>Sckit-learn</li>
										</ul>
										<p>And so many more</p>
